            <br></br>
            <p>Hello! Thanks so much for stopping by my website.</p>
            <p>
              I've been interested in fine art from a young age, but I never
              thought that I could have a future as an artist. My sophomore year
              of high school was a turning point because I was introduced to the
              wonderful world of digital art. I took a class that introduced me
              to design of almost every kind and I truly began to grasp a larger
              understanding of art as a whole. Instead of using brushes, paint,
              and a canvas, I realized I could create art with photography,
              graphic design, and typography. It's something that I love
              practicing and constantly learning about and I'm thrilled that
              Iâ€™ve been able to make a career of it!
